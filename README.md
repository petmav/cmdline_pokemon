This repository is an experiment to see if my own personal skills are great enough to tackle creating a PokÃ©mon game.

No guarantees of quality lol.

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a beginner programmer currently studying at the University of Sydney and am attempting to push my knowledge of programming (in Python and other languages) further :D.
